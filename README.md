Hello there!

My name is Benjamin Tylka and I am a student at the University of Illinois Chicago majoring in Computer Science with a focus on Programming.

I am currently seeking opportunities for internships near Chicago, IL, but I am always open to remote positions!


## Current focuses
I am currently learning how to develop mods for video games such as Minecraft, but I am interested in making mods for Terraria and other simple game as well down the line.

Improving my skills in Java, C, C++, Python.
## Other simple facts
I am a second generation male with both of my parents coming from Poland.

I enjoy photography, reading, working out, and riding my motorcycle (when its warm) in my free time.
