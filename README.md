Hello there!

My name is Benjamin Tylka and I am a student at the University of Illinois Chicago majoring in Computer Science with a focus on Programming.

I am currently seeking opportunities for internships near Chicago, IL, but I am always open to remote positions!


## Current focuses
I am currently learning how to develop mods for video games such as Minecraft, but I am interested in making mods for Terraria and other simple game as well down the line.


## Other simple facts
I am a second generation male with my parents both coming from Poland.

I enjoy photography, reading, and working out in my free time.
